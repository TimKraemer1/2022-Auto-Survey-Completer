# 2022-Auto-Survey-Completer
This script was made to automate the process of completing a COVID symptoms survey at UCSC

The reason I made this script is that at UCSC, we would have to complete a daily COVID symptoms survey to access the dining halls. It would was 5 minutes of our lives since we had to login, go through authentication, complete the survey, and then take a screenshot of the completion certificate. 

This script uses many libraries that were new to me such as Selenium, smtplib, email.message, and imghdr. When running, you would place the google chrome app in the same folder as the program, so it could easily find it and access it. 

Sadly, UCSC first changed the process of completing the survey, and then removed the requirement now altogether, so this script does not function anymore, however I still include it in my GitHub as reference to show how it works.
