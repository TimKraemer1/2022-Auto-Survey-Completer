# 2022 Auto Survey Completer

A Python automation script designed to streamline the daily COVID-19 symptom survey process at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

At UCSC, students were required to complete a COVID-19 symptom survey each day in order to access the dining halls. The process—logging in, authenticating, completing the form, and capturing a screenshot of the completion certificate—could take up to 5 minutes daily.

This script was created to automate that workflow, saving time and ensuring consistent compliance with university requirements.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was a learning opportunity that introduced me to several new Python libraries:

- **Selenium** – Browser automation  
- **smtplib, email.message, imghdr** – Sending email notifications and screenshots  
- **Google Chrome WebDriver** – Required to automate the survey process via browser control

> *Note: The Chrome application needed to be placed in the same folder as the script for successful execution.*

## 📉 Project Status

Unfortunately, this script is no longer functional due to the following:

1. UCSC updated the process for completing the daily survey.
2. The survey requirement was eventually removed altogether.

Despite this, the project remains available in this repository as a reference and example of browser automation, email integration, and practical scripting.

## 📎 Disclaimer

This tool was created for educational and personal use only. It was intended to assist with a repetitive task in compliance with university policy at the time.
